      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        When an application captures a [=display-surface=], the user agent faces a decision - should
        the captured [=display-surface=] be brought to the forefront of the user's screen
        ("focused"), or should the capturing application retain focus. This document proposes a
        mechanism by which an application can influence this decision.

        This document uses the definition of the following concepts from [[SCREEN-CAPTURE]]:
        <dfn>display-surface</dfn>, <dfn>application</dfn> [=display-surface=],
        <dfn>browser</dfn> [=display-surface=], <dfn>window</dfn> [=display-surface=] and
        <dfn>monitor</dfn> [=display-surface=].

    <section id="problem-desc">
      <h2>Problem Description</h2>
      <p>
        Assume a Web-application that calls {{MediaDevices/getDisplayMedia()}} and the user chooses
        to capture a tab or a window. It is not currently specified whether the user agent should
        focus the captured [=display-surface=], or let the capturing application retrain focus.
      </p>
      <p>
        The user agent is mostly agnostic of the nature of the capturing and captured applications,
        and is therefore not well-positioned to make an informed decision with regards to focus.
      </p>
      <p>
        In contrast, the capturing application is familiar with its own properties, and is better
        positioned to make this decision. Moreover, by reading
        {{MediaTrackConstraintSet/displaySurface}} and/or using
        <a href="https://wicg.github.io/capture-handle/">Capture Handle</a>, the capturing
        application can learn about the captured [=display-surface=], driving an even more informed
        decision.
      </p>
      <p>For example, a video conferencing application may wish to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Hand-off focus to interactive captured applications, like text editors.</li>
        <li>Retain focus when capturing less interactive applications, like video players.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="conditional-focus-mechanism">
      <h2>The Conditional-Focus Mechanism</h2>
      <p>
        The conditional-focus mechanism allows the capturing application to instruct the user agent
        to either switch focus to the captured [=display-surface=], or to avoid such a focus change.
      </p>
      <p>
        The window of opportunity for the application to make the decision is defined. If the
        mechanism is not invoked within this window of opportunity, the user agent takes over and
        makes its own decision.

          {{MediaDevices/getDisplayMedia()}} is currently defined such that it returns a
          {{Promise}}&lt;{{MediaStream}}&gt;. We extend this definition such that when
          {{MediaDevices/getDisplayMedia()}} is called, if the user elects to capture either an
          [=application=], [=browser=] or [=window=] [=display-surface=], the video track of the
          aforementioned {{MediaStream}} will be of type {{FocusableMediaStreamTrack}}.

        <h2><dfn>FocusableMediaStreamTrack</dfn></h2>
        <p>{{MediaStreamTrack}} is subclassed as {{FocusableMediaStreamTrack}}.</p>
        <pre class="idl">
          [Exposed=Window]
          interface FocusableMediaStreamTrack : MediaStreamTrack {
            undefined focus(CaptureStartFocusBehavior focus_behavior);
          };

          enum CaptureStartFocusBehavior {
            "focus-captured-surface",
            "no-focus-change"
          };
        </pre>
        <dl data-link-for="FocusableMediaStreamTrack" data-dfn-for="FocusableMediaStreamTrack">
          <dt>
            <dfn>focus()</dfn>
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              Recall that the {{FocusableMediaStreamTrack}} object was instantiated in response to a
              call to {{MediaDevices/getDisplayMedia()}}. That call to
              {{MediaDevices/getDisplayMedia()}} returned a {{Promise}}&lt;{{MediaStream}}&gt;
              <code>PRMS</code>. Like any {{Promise}}, <code>PRMS</code> is settled on a microtask,
              which we will name <code>MT</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
              When <code>MT</code> starts executing, a window of opportunity opens for the
              application to inform the user agent as to whether it wants the captured
              [=display-surface=] to be focused or not. Calls to {{focus()}} may only have an effect
              while this window of opportunity is open. It closes as soon as one of the following
              happens:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>{{focus()}} is called for the first time.</li>
              <li><code>MT</code> finishes.</li>
              <li>One second passes since the capture was started.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              When the window of opportunity closes, if an explicit decision was not made through
              calling {{focus()}}, then the user agent MUST make its own decision.
            </p>
            <p>
              Therefore, when {{focus()}} is called, the user agent MUST run the following steps:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                If this object is a clone, raise an {{InvalidStateError}}. Otherwise, proceed.
              </li>
              <li>
                If {{focus()}} was previously called on [=this=], raise an {{InvalidStateError}}.
                Otherwise, proceed.
              </li>
              <li>
                If this call to {{focus()}} is not on <code>MT</code>, the user agent MUST have
                already made a decision, so raise an {{InvalidStateError}}. Otherwise, proceed.
              </li>
              <li>
                If this call to {{focus()}} occurs more than one second after the start of the
                capture, the user agent MUST have already made a decision. The user agent MUST
                silently ignore this call {{focus()}}.
              </li>
              <li>
                This call to {{focus()}} occurred on <code>MT</code> and within one second of the
                capture starting. Therefore, the user agent MUST NOT make its own decision with
                respect to focusing the captured [=display-surface=], but rather:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    If <code>focus_behavior</code> is set to
                    {{CaptureStartFocusBehavior/"focus-captured-surface"}}, then the user agent MUST
                    focus the captured [=display-surface=].
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If <code>focus_behavior</code> is set to
                    {{CaptureStartFocusBehavior/"no-focus-change"}}, then the user agent MUST NOT
                    focus the captured [=display-surface=].
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </dd>

        <h2>Usage Samples</h2>
        <p>
          All examples will assume a predicate named <code>shouldFocus()</code> which accepts a
          video {{MediaStreamTrack}} as input. It is a synchronous function returning either
          {{CaptureStartFocusBehavior/"no-focus-change"}} or
          {{CaptureStartFocusBehavior/"focus-captured-surface"}}. Reasonable implementations of this
          predicate include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Hard-code to always focus.</li>
          <li>Hard-code to never focus.</li>
          <li>Base the decision on a user preference obtain in-app.</li>
          <li>
            Base the decision on the captured [=display-surface=]'s {{DisplayCaptureSurfaceType}}.
          </li>
          <li>Base the decision on the captured application (using Capture Handle).</li>
