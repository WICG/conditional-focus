      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        When an application captures a [=display-surface=], the user agent faces a decision - should
        the captured [=display-surface=] be brought to the forefront of the user's screen
        ("focused"), or should the capturing application retain focus. This document proposes a
        mechanism by which an application can influence this decision.

      <p>
        This document uses the definition of the following concepts from [[SCREEN-CAPTURE]]:
        <dfn>display-surface</dfn>, <dfn>application</dfn> [=display-surface=],
        <dfn>browser</dfn> [=display-surface=], <dfn>window</dfn> [=display-surface=] and
        <dfn>monitor</dfn> [=display-surface=].

    <section id="problem-desc">
      <h2>Problem Description</h2>
      <p>
        Assume a Web-application that calls {{MediaDevices/getDisplayMedia()}} and the user chooses
        to capture a tab or a window. It is not currently specified whether the user agent should
        focus the captured [=display-surface=], or let the capturing application retrain focus.
      </p>
      <p>
        The user agent is mostly agnostic of the nature of the capturing and captured applications,
        and is therefore not well-positioned to make an informed decision with regards to focus.
      </p>
      <p>
        In contrast, the capturing application is familiar with its own properties, and is better
        positioned to make this decision. Moreover, by reading
        {{MediaTrackConstraintSet/displaySurface}} and/or using
        <a href="https://wicg.github.io/capture-handle/">Capture Handle</a>, the capturing
        application can learn about the captured [=display-surface=], driving an even more informed
        decision.
      </p>
      <p>For example, a video conferencing application may wish to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Hand-off focus to interactive captured applications, like text editors.</li>
        <li>Retain focus when capturing less interactive applications, like video players.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="conditional-focus-mechanism">
      <h2>The Conditional-Focus Mechanism</h2>
      <p>
        The conditional-focus mechanism allows the capturing application to instruct the user agent
        to either switch focus to the captured [=display-surface=], or to avoid such a focus change.
      </p>
      <p>
        The window of opportunity for the application to make the decision is defined. If the
        mechanism is not invoked within this window of opportunity, the user agent takes over and
        makes its own decision.

        <p>
          {{MediaDevices/getDisplayMedia()}} is currently defined such that it returns a
          {{Promise}}&lt;{{MediaStream}}&gt;. We extend this definition such that when
          {{MediaDevices/getDisplayMedia()}} is called, if the user elects to capture either an
          [=application=], [=browser=] or [=window=] [=display-surface=], the video track of the
          aforementioned {{MediaStream}} will be of type {{FocusableMediaStreamTrack}}.

      <section id="focusable-media-stream-track">
        <h2><dfn>FocusableMediaStreamTrack</dfn></h2>
        <p>{{MediaStreamTrack}} is subclassed as {{FocusableMediaStreamTrack}}.</p>
        <pre class="idl">
          [Exposed=Window]
          interface FocusableMediaStreamTrack : MediaStreamTrack {
            undefined focus(CaptureStartFocusBehavior focus_behavior);
            MediaStreamTrack clone();
          };

          enum CaptureStartFocusBehavior {
            "focus-captured-surface",
            "no-focus-change"
          };
        </pre>
        <dl data-link-for="FocusableMediaStreamTrack" data-dfn-for="FocusableMediaStreamTrack">
          <dt>
            <dfn>focus()</dfn>
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              Recall that the {{FocusableMediaStreamTrack}} object was instantiated in response to a
              call to {{MediaDevices/getDisplayMedia()}}. That call to
              {{MediaDevices/getDisplayMedia()}} returned a {{Promise}}&lt;{{MediaStream}}&gt;, and
              that {{Promise}} was resolved on a microtask, which we will name <code>MT</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
              When the {{focus()}} method is called, the user agent MUST run the following steps:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                If {{focus()}} was previously called on this object, raise an {{InvalidStateError}}.
                Otherwise, proceed.
              </li>
              <li>
                If {{focus()}} was not called on <code>MT</code>, raise an {{InvalidStateError}}.
                Otherwise, proceed.
              </li>
              <li>
                If this call to {{focus()}} happens more than one second after the start of the
                capture, the user agent SHOULD have already made its own decision. The user agent
                SHOULD silently ignore this call {{focus()}}.
              </li>
              <li>
                This call to {{focus()}} occurred on <code>MT</code> and within one second of the
                capture starting. Therefore, the user agent MUST NOT make its own decision with
                respect to focusing the captured [=display-surface=], but rather:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    If <code>focus_behavior</code> is set to
                    {{CaptureStartFocusBehavior/"focus-captured-surface"}}, then the user agent MUST
                    focus the captured [=display-surface=].
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If <code>focus_behavior</code> is set to
                    {{CaptureStartFocusBehavior/"no-focus-change"}}, then the user agent MUST NOT
                    focus the captured [=display-surface=].
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </dd>
          <dt>
            <dfn>clone()</dfn>
          </dt>
          <dd>
            Calls to {{clone()}} MUST return an object of type {{MediaStreamTrack}}, thereby stripping
            away the ability to call {{focus()}} on a cloned track.
